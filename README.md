## Summary

This project analyzes the impact of **Haptic Feedback** on user behavior and business metrics using A/B testing.

Two user groups were compared:

- **Transactions**: Increased (p = 0.0069)

### ❌ No Significant Change
- Sessions
- New Users
- Pages per Session
- Revenue
- Bounce Rate (Chi-Square p = 0.5346)

## Trend Observations

- **Session Trends**: Similar for both groups
- **Transactions**: Higher and more consistent in the Haptic group
- **Revenue**: Slight upward trend in the Haptic group but not significant

## Business Impact

### Positive:
- Users stay longer
- More purchases completed

### Neutral/Negative:
- No increase in total sessions or new users
- Bounce rate unchanged
- Revenue not significantly improved

## Final Recommendation

- **Use Haptic Feedback** if your goal is to increase engagement and conversions.
- **Do not rely on Haptics alone** for revenue growth or bounce rate reduction.
- Combine with:
  - Personalized promotions

  - Improved checkout UX

## Conclusion

Haptic Feedback improves user engagement and transactions, but needs to be paired with other strategies to boost revenue and reduce bounce rates.
